#### Project Overview:

sampleRun.py file should contain serveral board situaltion and play the game.
it should also print out all the steps taken in a 8x8 grid for analysis.

sampleTest.py should be test cases where important functions/algorithms are to be tested against.

othello.py should contain everything the game needs to be play, i.e. the 8x8 board, the rules of placing down pieces, the winning condition check. etc.

engine.py should contain an engine that drives the entire program. Initiating the engine will start the search algorithms and different analysis tools.

algorithms.py should contain the search algirthm and strategies we'll implment to achieve 2 AI playing Othello.
